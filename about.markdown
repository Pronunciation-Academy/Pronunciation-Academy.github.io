This course is aimed for all levels. The idea is simple: for every sound there is a video with a native Polish speaker pronouncing the sound itself and then words and sentences containing it. The only thing you have to do is to listen and repeat everything after the speaker. To learn a sound well you have to do the same lesson a lot of times until you feel you pronounce it correctly. So, please, don't rush. If you spend enough time doing this exercise you will speak like a native speaker but that will take a long time.
